# Auto-Deployment Test

This file tests whether GitHub integration with Vercel is working properly.

When you push changes to the `main` branch, Vercel should automatically:

1. âœ… Detect the changes from GitHub
2. âœ… Trigger a new deployment 
3. âœ… Build and deploy the updated application
4. âœ… Update the live URL with new changes

## Current Status

- **Repository**: Connected to Vercel
- **Auto-deployment**: Enabled
- **Branch**: main (production)
- **Live URL**: https://swisp-lw54by11b-shamroz-warraichs-projects.vercel.app

## Test

If you can see this file content updated on the live site, auto-deployment is working! ðŸŽ‰
